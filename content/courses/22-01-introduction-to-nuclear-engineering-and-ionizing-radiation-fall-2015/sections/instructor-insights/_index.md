Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _22.01 Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation_ as it was taught by Professor Michael Short in Fall 2015.

This course is a hands-on approach to ionizing radiation. Radiation is the central aspect that makes nuclear science and engineering (NSE) its own discipline, and sets the foundation for almost all of modern physics. The course begins by retracing the steps of famous radiation experiments and hypotheses. Next, the stage is set for the study of radiation, by showing details of the systems and reactors that use radiation. The remaining portion of the course is dedicated to describing the origins, interactions, uses, detection, and biological/chemical effects of ionizing radiation.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Develop fluency in basic nuclear physics
*   Learn about seminal radiation experiments and hypotheses
*   Explore systems and reactors that use radiation
*   Describe the origins, interactions, uses, detection, and biological/chemical effects of ionizing radiation
*   Apply knowledge of nuclear physics to evaluate quality of scientific claims

Curriculum Information
----------------------

### Prerequisites

This course, which is the first subject in the Nuclear Science and Engineering undergraduate degree sequence, has no prerequisites. It is generally taken in the first semester of sophomore year, after two semesters of freshman calculus and physics.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

Lecture
-------

var pieData = \[ { value: 25, color: "#931101" }, { value: 75, color: "#eee" } \]; var myPie = new Chart(document.getElementById("canvas1").getContext("2d")).Pie(pieData); 3 hours per week

Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 25 sessions total.

Recitation
----------

var pieData = \[ { value: 25, color: "#eee" }, { value: 17, color: "#931101" }, { value: 58, color: "#eee" } \]; var myPie = new Chart(document.getElementById("canvas2").getContext("2d")).Pie(pieData); 2 hours per week

*   Met 1 time per week for 2 hours per session; 12 sessions total.
*   Recitation sessions included explanations of course content and demonstrations.

Out of Class
------------

var pieData = \[ { value: 42, color: "#eee" }, { value: 58, color: "#931101" } \]; var myPie = new Chart(document.getElementById("canvas3").getContext("2d")).Pie(pieData); 7 hours per week

*   Problem sets or labs
*   Quiz preparation
